Say we have a Software Development Department at ACME Company. They are tasked with creating and maintaining all the software that ACME sells. The bulk of their daily work is adding new features to current product lines and working on bug fixes. Now and then this Software Development Department has an idea that they think is fantastic. No really, this idea is a real heck of an idea! They attempt to persuade management in investing development hours into their idea after having put together a small prototype for demonstration. However the issue at hand is management does not have full confidence that ACME clients will want such a new and different product. What can the ACME Developers do to prevent their idea from dying on the table? Why they can utilize Marketing as a tool to grow their idea!

Many times it takes more than a group of great Software Engineers to produce a successful software product. Other departments and disciplines must be brought in on the development process throughout the Software&#8217;s life cycle. Out of the various groups that can be included, and one of the more powerful ones, can be considered as Marketing. With Marketing, many important and required aspects of a successful launch would be nonexistent at the actual launch.

So what does Marketing bring to the table as far as Software Development is concerned? Well let&#8217;s run through a brief, high level overview:

***Marketing the Prototype Key Points:***

  * Can cultivate early interest in developing projects and products.
  * Can generate early client input while it is easier to make sweeping changes in the software.
  * Interested clients can be offered a &#8220;Beta Invitation&#8221; to use the product.
  * Beta testers can provide feedback all of which can be used to further improve the product before official launch.
  * Beta testers can provide bug reports.
  * Having Beta testers is an economical way to add additional testing to new products with minimal investment of company resources.
  * Can be used as &#8220;word of mouth&#8221; marketing and drive even more interest in the project from possible clients
  * &#8230;and of course all of these Beta Testing aspects improve the product overtime before its release.

  * Seriously interested clients can then be offered the opportunity to purchase the software ahead of time as a &#8220;pre-order&#8221;. Incentives along with that can include:
  * Early Access to the new Software
  * Introductory discount Pricing
  * &#8220;Founder&#8221; benefits or other special additions

Hopefully this brief, high level overview of applying Marketing techniques to Software Development comes in handy. Marketing is not the only other Department that can support a project you are incubating. It is worthwhile for every Software project you take on to invest the time to think of all other possible resources and specialties that can be used during a development cycle.

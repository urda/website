The journey a software project takes is a very long one. It begins with an idea, which becomes formulated, grows, is tested, and finally &#8220;put out to pasture&#8221; in production. Plenty of software projects never make it past the &#8220;idea&#8221; stage and die very young. But the projects that keep the momentum high and keep the challenges under control slowly work their way to production. Production is, usually, the final stage where a piece of software is released for client consumption. Today we will go over a very basic trail a particular piece of software may follow.

For any major software project there are three major chunks to cover during construction: planning & development, testing & debugging, and then production release. Each phase has it&#8217;s own unique characteristics, and each phase is equally important to a software project.

The first steps in any great piece of software is the planning & development phase. This is where the framework is laid out by the project architects, and various mock up designs and specifications documents get work on. After the plans are created, developers can jump straight writing the software. Eventually a working copy is produced, and the project is ready for the next stage.

After a working copy of the project is available, it should be time to push it off to a QA or testing team within your company. This will allow you to go back to removing quirks or known bugs throughout the project (since after all no first version is perfect). Hopefully your QA team comes back rapidly, and will probably have one or more bugs to report on the project. You can then triage these and get back to updating the codebase. You&#8217;ll bounce from development, to testing, back to development many times throughout the product&#8217;s lifetime.

Once the team is happy with a finished product, it will be time to move it out to production. If it is a web application you&#8217;ll need to prepare the server environment for the new project. If it happens to be desktop or other client software you&#8217;ll need to come up with a distribution plan. Whatever it is you are working on, this is the part where your hard work will (hopefully) pay off! A product making it to production is a wonderful thing, and when it works well it will make your clients very happy!

But don&#8217;t get to snug after your application makes it to production, you got to get back to the first stage and start making the next version! Happy Developing!

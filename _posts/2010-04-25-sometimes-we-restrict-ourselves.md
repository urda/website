When I brought up this site and started writing articles on it, I found myself to have already bound myself to a single concept and idea. Originally a lot of the drafts I have created and the articles I have published have been technology related. However as time went on, I found interesting current events that I wanted to comment or react to in this space. Being locked in to a single concept of technology tips and tricks prevented me from doing so.

So I have made the scope of this blog a bit more general, to allow not only for just tech articles and how-to instructions, but for anything else that I may want to share with you. This will also provide a bit more reading material, and not long posts separated by long tracks of time. So you&#8217;ll still get your tech related stuff, just expect a bit more of everything and plenty of ramblings to come.

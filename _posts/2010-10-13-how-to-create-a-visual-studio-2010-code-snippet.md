As you work through various projects in Visual Studio 2010 you will find
yourself reusing a lot of code. In fact, you may find yourself reusing a lot of
the same static code, or code that follows a basic pattern. Visual Studio 2010
lets you cut out a lot of this wasted time by employing code snippets. Code
snippets can generate basic code patterns or layouts on the fly inside your
project. Today I will walk you through creating a basic code snippet for
generating a C# class with specific section stubs.

You will need to start with a generic XML file. You'll want to keep the XML
declaration line inside the file once you create it and change the file
extension from **.xml** to **.snippet**. For reference I store my stubs inside
**"C:\Users\Peter\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Code Snippets\Visual C#\Custom"**

Now we can go ahead our XML stub! We will first fill out the required schema
information:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<CodeSnippets xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2005/CodeSnippet">
  <CodeSnippet Format="1.0.0">

    <!-- Come with me, and you'll be... -->

  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeSnippets>
```

Now we are ready to fill out our header information. The header is used to
define things such as the title of the snippet, the author, the shortcut for
IntelliSense , and a description. The header will also define the snippet type
(you can read all about the options of snippet type
[here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171442%28v=vs.110%29.aspx))
that the snippet will act as. So we will fill out our header now:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<CodeSnippets xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2005/CodeSnippet">
  <CodeSnippet Format="1.0.0">
    <Header>
      <Title>Build Class With #regions</Title>
      <Author>Peter Urda</Author>
      <Shortcut>BuildClassWithRegions</Shortcut>
      <Description>Creates a Class With Common #region Sections</Description>
      <SnippetTypes>
        <SnippetType>Expansion</SnippetType>
      </SnippetTypes>
    </Header>

    <!-- ...in a world of pure imagination... -->

  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeSnippets>
```

Our next element, which will also be a child of the **CodeSnippet** element,
will define the properties of the actual snippet to be inserted. Now for this
example I wanted to be able to replace a single chunk of the snippet when I call
the snippet from Visual Studio. This will require the addition of a
**Declarations** section that will control this behavior.

The declaration section can either contain an **Object** type or a **Literal**
type. We will be covering the Literal type in this example. The literal has an
ID, ToolTip, and a Default value. The ID is used by the snippet for where the
actual replacement occurs. The ToolTip tag will be used by IntelliSense to give
the end-user a hint as to the purpose of the code section that is being worked
on. Finally, a default value is declared to be displayed before the user makes
the change.

We will go ahead and fill the section out now:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<CodeSnippets xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2005/CodeSnippet">
  <CodeSnippet Format="1.0.0">
    <Header>
      <Title>Build Class With #regions</Title>
      <Author>Peter Urda</Author>
      <Shortcut>BuildClassWithRegions</Shortcut>
      <Description>Creates a Class With Common #region Sections</Description>
      <SnippetTypes>
        <SnippetType>Expansion</SnippetType>
      </SnippetTypes>
    </Header>

    <Snippet>
      <Declarations>
        <Literal>
          <ID>ClassName</ID>
          <ToolTip>Replace with the desired class name.</ToolTip>
          <Default>ClassName</Default>
        </Literal>
      </Declarations>

      <!-- ...take a look and you'll see into your imagination... -->

    </Snippet>
  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeSnippets>
```

Now we can fill out the final section that will contain the actual code
generated by the snippet. We will go ahead and declare that this code is for C#,
and create the required tags before we start entering in our code:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<CodeSnippets xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2005/CodeSnippet">
  <CodeSnippet Format="1.0.0">
    <Header>
      <Title>Build Class With #regions</Title>
      <Author>Peter Urda</Author>
      <Shortcut>BuildClassWithRegions</Shortcut>
      <Description>Creates a Class With Common #region Sections</Description>
      <SnippetTypes>
        <SnippetType>Expansion</SnippetType>
      </SnippetTypes>
    </Header>

    <Snippet>
      <Declarations>
        <Literal>
          <ID>ClassName</ID>
          <ToolTip>Replace with the desired class name.</ToolTip>
          <Default>ClassName</Default>
        </Literal>
      </Declarations>

      <Code Language="CSharp">
        <![CDATA[
        /*
        ...we'll begin with a spin traveling in the world of my creation...
        */
        ]]>
      </Code>
    </Snippet>
  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeSnippets>
```

We will being to enter the code our snippet will generate inside this last
section. All the code to be generated by the snippet needs to be placed between
the **<![CDATA[** **<!--[CDATA[-->** and

**]]>** tags. If you fail to do so, your snippet will not work. We also want to
call back to the literal declaration we made inside the code. To do this we
simply surround the name of the literal with the **$** symbol. You should be
able to deduce what the snippet will generate from the complete snippet file
below:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<CodeSnippets xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2005/CodeSnippet">
  <CodeSnippet Format="1.0.0">
    <Header>
      <Title>Build Class With #regions</Title>
      <Author>Peter Urda</Author>
      <Shortcut>BuildClassWithRegions</Shortcut>
      <Description>Creates a Class With Common #region Sections</Description>
      <SnippetTypes>
        <SnippetType>Expansion</SnippetType>
      </SnippetTypes>
    </Header>

    <Snippet>
      <Declarations>
        <Literal>
          <ID>ClassName</ID>
          <ToolTip>Replace with the desired class name.</ToolTip>
          <Default>ClassName</Default>
        </Literal>
      </Declarations>

      <Code Language="CSharp">
        <![CDATA[class $ClassName$
        {
            #region Public Properties

            #endregion

            #region Private Properties

            #endregion

            #region Constructors

            #endregion

            #region Public Methods

            #endregion

            #region Private Methods

            #endregion
        }]]>
      </Code>
    </Snippet>
  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeSnippets>

<!-- ...what we'll see will defy explanation. -->
```

So after all this work we still need to tell Visual Studio 2010 where to find
this snippet file. To do this we will need to open the Code Snippets Manager
from **Tools -> Code Snippets Manager...** or with the default keyboard shortcut
**CTRL+K, CTRL+B** inside Visual Studio. Once that is open you may need to
reference your custom folder (Mine was at
"C:\Users\Peter\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Code Snippets\Visual C#\Custom" for
reference) using the "Add.." button. You can then click do the following:

* Click "Import..."
* Browse to the location of your snippet
* Select the folder you would like Visual Studio to store said snippet
  (I used my "Custom" folder)
* ..and your done!

If you take a peak back at the main Code Snippets Manager window and find your
new snippet you'll be presented with a screen detailing the information from the header section:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098" title="Code Snippets Manager After Adding Snippet" src="http://www.peter-urda.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Code-Snippets-Manager-After-Add.png" alt="Code Snippets Manager After Adding Snippet" width="629" height="469" />

So now just jump back to your C# project and you should be able to just type
**'b'** or **'B'** for IntelliSense to prompt you with the following:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097" title="Code Snippets Before Double-Tab" src="http://www.peter-urda.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Code-Snippets-Before-Call.png" alt="Code Snippets Before Double-Tab" width="512" height="224" />

Like any other snippet (such as prop) a double tab after that point will fill
out the code and jump your cursor to the class name for you to rename:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1096" title="Code Snippet After Double-Tab" src="http://www.peter-urda.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Code-Snippets-After-Call.png" alt="Code Snippet After Double-Tab" width="256" height="367" />

Today marked the beginning of my real co-op experience and work tasks here at Mercer. The morning started off with a conference call with dev-team members from China, India, and the rest of us here in Louisville via teleconferencing.Â  The reason for the meeting was to demo the new features and functionality of the latest release for a Mercer product. Deployment will be occurring later this week, but before that could happen some last minute testing needed to be done. I had the opportunity to get a rundown of the internals of the product, and from there performed testing on a new file manager to check for any missed bugs or problems. Throughout all of this I learned how Mercer developed any project starting from conception, to testing, and final delivery to production. While no single step is an easy task, Mercer&#8217;s method produces undeniable results and amazing software.

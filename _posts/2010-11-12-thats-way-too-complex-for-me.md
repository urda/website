I was assisting some younger CECS students during my tutor shift the other day. They were working on a basic C++ application for their introduction course into programming. One had issues understanding a few Object Oriented Programming concepts, the other was simply overwhelmed by the requirements of his assignment. So I spoke with them and shared a few of my tips about handling these situations and how to get the best out of them.

I'll touch on the issue with some concepts first. This student was having difficulty understanding the importance of inheritance, mostly because he had never used it before in his projects. So in response to his question I prompted him with "Well if you had to make a variety of vehicles in your program, wouldn't you want all their respective wheels to uphold to a standard?" He obviously responded with a firm "absolutely" and quickly picked up the clear reason for basic inheritance and class extensions. When I have issues following a new concept, I try my best to break it into common terms and relate it to a real life scenario. After that I can piece together the real picture and understand the new concept. This approach also seems to work very well when explaining new concepts to other students.

The other student was working on another lab assignment. He was just starting off and had come into the tutoring center for support. He was just overwhelmed by all the things the project called for, and he was worried about how everything would click together in the end. He was so worried he was having some difficulty getting started. First I brought his attention to some pen and paper, and told him it would be best to sketch out or write your work flow on paper. 

After he worked some of the first ideas out, he started worrying about all the requirements again. I brought him back to his writing and told him that he shouldn't even attempt to hit all the points at once, nothing will get done! I told him when it comes to programming you need to a zen-like approach to it. Focus on one task and one task only, there are no other tasks at any time when you are working on your current task. Once you have that chunk of code finished and working, then and only then do you move to the next chunk. Repeat this method until your program is code complete! This gave him something to think about, and he started to make progress in his lab after hearing it.

So the two key concepts you should walk away from this is one, you won't always understand a concept the first time and that's fine. Two, the entire journey must be made step by step to be successful.

You finally made it! You worked long hours and many weeks to bring your small software idea for your company all the way to a "production ready" state. There is only one obstacle in your way, give a brilliant demonstration of your software to show how much value it adds for your employer to take advantage of. But what makes a good demo?

There is a popular quote that has floated around the internet for some time in reference to product demonstrations:

> The probability of failure of a software demonstration is directly proportional to the product of the number of people attending and the importance of the demo.

On a given demo you have countless man hours invested and obstacle overcome to bring a product to a "production ready" status. Before it can proceed off to production to live a happy life, it often needs one final approval from the business before sale or release. This approval often hinges on the demonstration, which will make or break any software project. Do or die.

There are a few characteristics that make up a great demonstration. The first major one is preparation. If you have taken the time to review your presentation, the data set you'll be using, and practicing the phrases to say you'll be better off during the demonstration. In fact, you'll come off with a commanding respect with the appearance that you know this software forward, backwards, and upside down.

Another key trait is acknowledging existing problems. If a bug is big enough to cause trouble during a demo, you better have a work around or mapped out a plan for the business that will correct the bug. Going into a demo with buggy software is not only frustrating, but embarrassing to the development team.

Finally, be honest. If you didn't get feature C setup since features A and B took too much time, be up front with it. Address all possible issues your team may have faced during the development phases. Perhaps another department held you back as you waited for more information, or perhaps your Q & A team missed a few major sections of regression testing. Whatever the case, do **not** cover it up. Lying to the business will only ruin you in the end, and that can have a devastating impact on your job and career.

Relax! Know your product, acknowledge any possible issues, and be honest with the business. Once everything is over and you have your approval, enjoy your software launch!

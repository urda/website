Ok imagine this: you gather the world&#8217;s best and brightest engineers, physicists, chemists, and other professions of high end science and place them into a large warehouse. Now that you have them all gathered into this warehouse, you give them a TON of research resources and funding. Finally, you tell them to come up with something radical or revolutionary with the resources you have just provided them. Well my friend, you just launched your very own "Skunkworks Project".

A skunkworks project is a type of research and innovation initiative. It is best defined as the following:

> A skunkworks project is one typically developed by a small and loosely structured group of people who research and develop a project primarily for the sake of radical innovation.
> 
> A skunkworks project often operates with a high degree of autonomy and unhampered by bureaucracy, tasked with working on advanced or secret projects. These projects are often undertaken in secret with the understanding that if the development is successful then the product will be designed later according to the usual process.

If you can plan your resources, funding, and personal just right a skunkworks project may just work for you. For the employee or contractor, it is an opportunity to work on the most challenging and rewarding work he or she can participate in. For the corporation, it can be a unique and exciting way to generate brand new and radical ideas that your company can turn around for marketing or retail. It really can be used as a golden opportunity to create and develop without all the red-tape that might exist for a normal development process.

This is just one of many ways to spur innovation inside a corporation.

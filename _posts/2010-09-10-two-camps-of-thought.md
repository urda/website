When it comes to running a business the driving factor in many decisions is the "bottom line". The easiest way to express that is with the equation **Revenue &#8211; Cost = Profit**. Now in order to increase profit you want to minimize your cost and maximize your revenue. Actually doing that is a different story. Making changes to your product line is one way to bring in more cash, either by improving your current stuff or adding new products. However, there are generally two camps of thought when it comes to approaching this possibility.

One concept is to continue improving the core product. Since it is the cash cow of the company only more profits can come from adding functionality or improving it overall. Your customers will want to keep investing in your product, because you just keep adding on to it overtime. You try to avoid redeveloping new products, since that can be risky and has a larger up front cost to the company. This method can be thought of as "If it isn&#8217;t broken, don&#8217;t fix it".

The other idea is a more cutting edge point of view. Sure, your company can have the biggest and best Widget software in the world. But you cannot keep adding just new functionality to the same product over and over again. The fear is that you&#8217;ll end up losing your current customers and fail to attract new ones because you do not bring out new and exciting products overtime. This method prefers to constantly looking for new innovations or ideas to develop into full-fledged products and services.

So which one should you go with? Honestly, the best method is to use a hybrid of both ideas. You want to keep your current customers, so you should continue to improve and add-on to your flagship products and services. However, you need to dedicate a portion of time or a team to conduct research and development for new products and services. This does add to your cost, but the hopes are that your newer products attract new customers and also entice current customers to purchase even more goods from your company.

There are times throughout life where you may be in a slow state. Perhaps you are waiting for that one TPS Report to come in from the other side of town. Maybe you are waiting for a certification or clearance from the business to proceed with a plan. Perhaps you need to just take a break from the task at hand and switch gears to something else to recharge. It is during these times that you can offer more value to your company and peers than any other time.

Sure you can just sit around and browse the web in downtime, but you can also be productive with it! You could research new projects that your department may want to take on or you could re-visit a failed plan from years ago. Perhaps you want to pick up some personal skills that augment your career path. You may just have a pet project you work on during downtime that keeps you on your toes.

All of these things are a great way to keep your mind sharp and fresh. Nobody wants to be glued to a single project the rest of their lives. Give yourself some time-out, and play around with a small project of yours. Who knows, maybe you'll save yourself from burnout or come up with the next great thing. 

I can tell you one thing though: if you do nothing in your extra time, nothing will ever happen. So why not make the most of it?

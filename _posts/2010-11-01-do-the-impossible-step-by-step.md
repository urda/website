You&#8217;ve got a problem, and you think you can solve it. This solution could be the next big product or service to hit the public, and you have just got to get the execution down. But where in the world do you start? Every amazing journey or adventure starts with a single step, so you need a few ways to really get those creative ideas flowing!

If you are going to work on a big idea, you&#8217;re going to need to start small. You cannot expect to build an empire in a single day ergo you will not have a completely polished product as soon as you start working. Creation can be a bit messy, and these things take time. So don&#8217;t focus on the goal, take a zen approach and focus on a single task at a time and then move on to the next. Do one thing at a time and do it very well. Together, each of these smaller chunks will come together to generate an impressive result.

While you work along bit by bit, you&#8217;ll need some useful and simple tools to aid you in your progress. Over the years I have added many tools to my utility box for creative work. One can never have too many legal pads lying around, they are great for quick notes or jotting diagrams. For the more complex and larger scale markups, grab yourself a decent whiteboard and some dry erase markers. It also helps to type up your proposals or formal documents for long-term storage. 

Once you have all of your tools and ideas gathered, you&#8217;re going to need a good place to work. I recommend a well-lit room away from the television or life&#8217;s other distractions. It should be an open and clean room, giving you plenty of space to pace, stand, sit, and just think. A window is a bonus for when you just need to take a break from the creative process.

Just think about anything, think about everything, work slowly towards your goal, and enjoy the ride! I&#8217;m sure that idea of yours is going to be fantastic!

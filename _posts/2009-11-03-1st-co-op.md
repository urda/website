As a student of this program, I must complete three semesters of co-op work within the five years of year-round engineering education. So instead of going to classes, for a given semester I spend the entire time working in an engineering position of my field. That way when I complete my education in five years I&#8217;ll leave with not only a Master&#8217;s of Engineering, but have one year of work experience in my field. Since the beginning of my Fall 2009 semester I have interviewed with many companies in the hopes that I will get an offer for co-op. Today I finally locked in my co-op position with a company here in Louisville called *FacilityOne*.

Here is a quick overview of FacilityOne:

> FacilityONE transforms **any facility** (retail, office buildings, manufacturing, hospitals&#8230;) into the ultimate facility. FacilityONE&#8217;s web-based Facility Information Solution (FIS™) enables both executive management and front line operations people to document, manage, control and assess their facilities and associated systems. More intuitive and dramatically less expensive than traditional solutions, FacilityONE’s SmartPrint® technology puts you in control of every asset, helping you to maximize uptime and efficiency.

So what does this mean for me? Well it means I&#8217;ll be on the job in Spring 2010, and not having classes at all. A lot of the work I will be doing will be SQL and PHP related, and team devlopment of various modules to expand and improve FacilityOne&#8217;s software.

So of course I&#8217;ll be posting my experiances with my co-op when I can, so be sure to watch this space near the start of 2010!

**** On a side note I plan on having my first How-To article posted within the next week or two! Stay tuned.***

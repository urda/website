Without creativity, thinking, and even daydreaming some of the best products and applications would have never seen the light of day. Sure you can floor the world with a fantastic new software library, but if you cannot keep it updated or begin development on the next version you can expect to lose your edge in the market. I came across a fantastic quote today that one of my coworkers had thrown up on their whiteboard.

> Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone&#8230; Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth, and for increasing bottom-line results

It is short, simple, and easy to understand. Companies that just rehash their products, with no new additions or developments do not succeed very often. It is the groups that take risks, invest in various forms of research, and draw from their deep creativity to develop new and exciting products. Their clients will want to buy these exciting new products, and in turn allow the company to drive more funds to the creative groups to produce even superior services.

It really does pay to take the time and think outside of the box!
